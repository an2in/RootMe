# Root-Me Challenge Write-ups

Welcome to my **Root-Me** repository! This project contains my personal write-ups (`wu.md`), notes, and methodologies for solving various Capture The Flag (CTF) and cybersecurity challenges on [Root-Me.org](https://www.root-me.org/).

## Repository Structure

- **`wu.md`** — The main markdown file containing detailed write-ups, step-by-step solutions, and explanations for the challenges I've completed.
- **`img/`** — A directory storing screenshots, diagrams, and proof-of-concept images referenced in the write-ups.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
* Document my learning journey in penetration testing and cybersecurity.
* Keep a structured archive of techniques, scripts, and commands used to bypass various security mechanisms.
* Serve as a reference for myself and others who might want to learn about specific vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

These write-ups are provided for **educational purposes only**.
